# ShapeFlow

**ShapeFlow** is an easy-to-use 3D modeler for architectural and industrial designers. 

Built around **3D sketching** — drawing on surfaces to split and refine geometry, then extruding or applying flows — ShapeFlow adds **Flows** (reusable parametric rules attached to geometry) and a node-based **FlowChart** that mirrors the model hierarchy. 

ShapeFlow is **local-first**: no cloud dependency for core modeling or persistence, so your data and compute stay on your machine.
