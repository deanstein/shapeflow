# ShapeFlow

**ShapeFlow** is an easy-to-use 3D modeler for architectural and industrial designers.

This powerful and fluid modeling experience is built around:

- **3D sketching**: Drawing on surfaces to split and refine geometry, then extruding or applying flows.
- **Flows**: Reusable parametric rules attached to geometry.
- **FlowChart**: Node-based view that mirrors the model hierarchy. 

ShapeFlow is **local-first**: no cloud dependency for core modeling or persistence, so your data and compute stay on your machine.
